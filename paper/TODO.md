TODO
====

* Add mechanism to generate `preamble.tex`. Possible options:
  - Write a tex file that produces it. Not sure if simple enough.
  - Write a mixed biber + lua script to parse a formatted bibtex

* Use template name as document subtype. There is no way to get the template name right
  now.
